Moved the blog over from my homemade CMS on my Amazon EC2 instance to a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-powered GitHub page. I love the premise of Jekyll (manage your mostly-static sites as just that, and leverage the full power of Git and your desktop text editor when creating content) so decided to try this out. I migrated the couple worthy posts from the old blog over here. If you want to read old content that didn't make it I've archived the old blog at [oldskool.nicholas.zaillian.com](http://oldskool.nicholas.zaillian.com).
