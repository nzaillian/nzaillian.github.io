I wanted to watch <strong>Zero Dark Thirty</strong> last week. It was only available on DVD through Netflix, so I put it in my Queue and 2 days later I was watching it. Then I thought about what I had done.
</p>

<ul class="seq">
  <li><i class="icon-desktop"></i>I went to Netflix and selected the title</li>
  <li><i class="icon-building"></i>A person in a faraway warehouse pulled a disc with mpeg-encoded video from a shelf and put it on a conveyor belt</li>
  <li><i class="icon-truck"></i>The disc went in a truck and was driven to a mail sorting hub</li>
  <li><i class="icon-building"></i>The disc was through more conveyor belts and was placed on another, larger truck</li>
  <li><i class="icon-truck"></i>The disc was driven some much longer distance to my city's mail hub</li>
  <li><i class="icon-building"></i>The disc went through more conveyor belts and sorting to be placed on another smaller truck</li>
  <li><i class="icon-truck"></i>The disc was taken on a ride through the streets of my city and dropped at my door</li>
  <li><i class="icon-desktop"></i>I tore open the packaging and placed the DVD in a device that then read some mpeg-encoded video off of it</li>
</ul>

<p class="final">
I had ~4gb of mpeg content delivered with <strong>insane inefficiency (and cost, and impracticality, and environmental impact)</strong> because the copyright holders were not willing to get on board with an empirically more efficient and pleansant solution that leverages contemporary infrastructure.
