<p>I have a late 2014 15 in. macbook pro retina. It has a <a href='http://www.staingate.org/'>fucked up screen</a> (<a href='http://www.staingate.org/'>http://www.staingate.org/</a>). I was quoted $800 after tax for Apple to replace a display that was fucked up to begin with, and that I would have happily paid to proactively protect had I known it was so shitty.</p>

<p>My question to Apple is simply: “what the fuck?”. I have pampered my machine from the time I bought it. I literally waited for days to unbox it because I did not want to do so until the iPeal mCover I had bought on Amazon for it arrived and I could take it out of its factory plastic covering and place it directly in said full-body case.</p>

<p>I’m married to Apple products out of a professional requirement to work in a Unix environment (most of my work is developing web applications that are deployed to Linux servers) combined with the unfortunate reality that all competent design professionals in New York share their work in either .psd or .ai format files (for Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, respectively).</p>

<p>To reiterate, my matter is simple. All I want to know is: what the fuck? Please deal with this, Apple. Either tell us the displays are shit when we buy them and we'll happily buy protectors from you or replace them now that this is all happening.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
