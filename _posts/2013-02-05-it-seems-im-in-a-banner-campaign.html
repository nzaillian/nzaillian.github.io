<p>
  A friend of mine told me a few weeks ago that he thought he&#39;d seen me on a banner ad for the software freelancing site GroupTalent. &nbsp;He took a screencap and I confirmed it was, indeed, me. Today, I followed a link from a news aggregator to TechCrunch and, lo and behold, I saw my likeness! &nbsp;I took a screenshot, too (below).</p>
<div style="width:100%;text-align:center;">
  <a href="/images/posts/banner-campaign.jpg" style="display:block" target="_blank"> <img src="/images/posts/banner-campaign.jpg" style="width:100%" /> </a></div>
<p>
  For the record there is a precedent for this: a friend and I have worked through GroupTalent (and there&#39;s a testimonial of mine on the site). If you&#39;re a freelance developer with a decent-sized portfolio or a person looking to have a project built, GroupTalent is a resource worth your time.</p>
