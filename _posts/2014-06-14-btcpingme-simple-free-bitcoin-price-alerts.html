I've been using a popular Bitcoin price notification service to get notified when the price of Bitcoin drops below certain thresholds on certain exchanges. Last week I ran out of free account credits. I thought I could build something that covered the base functionality I needed out of the service.

<p>
I now present to you <a href='http://btcping.me' target='_blank'>BTCPing.me</a>!
</p>

<p>
It's a very minimal app that does the same sort of threshold-based email price alerts as these other services. 
I have a huge account credit with <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/' target='_blank'>DigitalOcean</a> that I got as a bounty for a "responsible disclosure" so I am running this
for free as a public service on a small VPS there. If you want to host your own instead you can grab source at <a href='https://github.com/nzaillian/btcping.me' target='_blank'>https://github.com/nzaillian/btcping.me</a>.
