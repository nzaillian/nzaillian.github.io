I was walking down to my favorite neighborhood coffee shop, <a href="http://www.portorico.com/", target="_blank">Porto Rico</a>, this lazy Sunday afternoon to get a coffee when I passed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner" target="_blank">Tom Preston-Werner</a> of Github and Gravatar fame having coffee at another neighborhood spot with his wife, Theresa. I did not wish to intrude but also felt I couldn't let the moment pass without just making a momentary show of gratitude. To my shock he ended up asking all about my own work and we talked for several minutes about Github, Jekyll and many other things.

It's incredible to encounter somebody who you have deeply revered from a distance for years and discover that they are gracious, cool and genuinely interested in the work of others. This encounter really made my day. If you ever see this, thanks so much for taking the time and being so gracious, Tom and Theresa!
